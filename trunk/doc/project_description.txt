Estimation of retention time prediction errors in liquid
chromatography
---------------------------------------------------------


Objective
---------------------------------------------------------

One of the typical steps of shotgun proteomics assays is liquid
chromatography, where peptides are separated according to their
hydrophobicity on a chromatography column. It has been shown that one
can predict the time that a peptide will spend on the chromatography
column, the so-called retention time, using the peptide sequence
alone, and various algorithms that provide such predictions are
available. Nevertheless, all these algorithms have often large
predictions errors for certain peptides. Here the goal is to
investigate different properties of the peptides that might explain
their large retention time prediction errors, and to build a predictor
that estimates these errors.



Materials
---------------------------------------------------------

A dataset including a list of peptide sequences identified in a
shotgun proteomics experiment at 1% false discovery rate (FDR). For
each peptide, the predicted and observed retention times are
provided. The data can be downloaded at:

What to do
---------------------------------------------------------

- Inspect the retention time prediction errors for the given
  peptides. Try to find patterns, and formulate hypotheses as to which
  properties of the peptides lead to larger prediction errors.

- Find an appropriate way to encode some of the properties identified
  in the previous step.

- Implement/use a method that employs the encoded peptide properties
  to predict the retention time prediction errors. Here you can use a
  machine learning-based method such as support vector machines
  implemented in some freely available package
  (e.g. http://svmlight.joachims.org/), some statistical technique, or
  implement your own algorithm.

- Report and discuss the results obtained.



Tips
---------------------------------------------------------

- Do not focus too much on the peptides with extreme prediction
  errors. Remember that the peptides are identified at 1% FDR. This
  means that 1% of these peptides have an incorrect peptide sequence
  assigned.

- If you cannot see any patterns regarding the properties of the
  peptides that get large retention time prediction errors, just be
  creative! Try to use different descriptors that can be calculated
  from the peptide sequence, and report the results obtained.
