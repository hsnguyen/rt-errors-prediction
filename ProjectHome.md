- Inspect the retention time prediction errors for the given peptides. Try to find patterns, and formulate hypotheses as to which properties of the peptides lead to larger prediction errors.

- Find an appropriate way to encode some of the roperties identified in the previous step.

- Implement/use a method that employs the encoded peptide properties to predict the retention time prediction errors. Here you can use a machine learning-based method such as support vector machines implemented in some freely available package (e.g. http://svmlight.joachims.org/), some statistical technique, or implement your own algorithm.

- Report and discuss the results obtained.
